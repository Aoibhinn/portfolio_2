## About
 
This website has been created for my Milestone 2 Interactive Frontend Development project.
 
I want to create a music quiz game to test the players coding terminology knowledge. The user will be given 4 random questions, worth 10 points a question, with 30 seconds to answer each. With a maximum of 40 points, the user will be able to save their high score and try to get on the top 5 leaderboard.
